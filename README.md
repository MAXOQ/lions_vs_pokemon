# lions_vs_pokemon
This is an attempt to answer the question on "who would win: 1 billion lions or one of every Pokémon?" in the most realistic simulation possible. 

This simulation will be in a battle royal format. 

This simulation will be made in rust using the macroquad library for visuals for no reason  other than that I have experience using it and it is relatively fast.
